            <b>Durga Prasai arrested in India, brought to Nepal over violent pro-monarchy protest</b> <br>
            Parbat Poudel <br>
            <br>
            Durga Prasai, the controversial businessman who led a violent pro-monarchy protest in Tinkune, Kathmandu, has been arrested in India and brought to Nepal through the Kakarbhitta border point.

            A Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) team is escorting him to Bhadrapur Airport for a flight to Kathmandu. His family and supporters had gathered at the Mechi Bridge since early Friday, awaiting his return.
            
            Police said Prasai, who fled after the March 28 protest, was detained near the eastern border by the Special Bureau. Three police teams had been deployed to India to track him down. However, Prasai’s associates claimed he had surrendered to the Assam Police in India.
            
            During the protest, Prasai breached the police barricade further provoking the protesters. His supporters vandalised, looted and torched 40 public and private buildings, including media outlets and commercial centres. A total of 69 vehicles were damaged.
            
            Journalist Suresh Rajak and Sabin Maharjan, a resident of Kirtipur, were killed, and 129 others were injured. Five remain hospitalised.
            
            Authorities have arrested dozens in connection with the violence, including Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) vice-chair Rabindra Mishra and general secretary Dhawal Shamsher Rana. They are being investigated on charges of sedition, organised crime, and public disorder.

            <b>Oli's address leaves Madhesh provincial assembly members unimpressed</b> <br>
            Binod Ghimre <br>
            <br>
            Since February, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been busy addressing provincial assemblies. He delivered a speech in Lumbini Provincial Assembly on February 5, then in Karnali and Sudurpaschim later the same month.

            On Tuesday, he appeared before the Madhesh Provincial Assembly, where he went at length about his efforts to resume Janakpur-Jaynagar railway line, construct Sunkoshi Marin diversion project and expedite construction of postal highway, among others. He also talked in detail about the need of protecting and strengthening national interest and sovereignty.

            “It is high time for all tiers of governments to come together to further institutionalise the present system,” he said, warning some undemocratic forces are resorting to violence in an attempt to overturn the hard-earned political gains. Oli also spared a good amount of time to claim Nepal has maintained good relations with neighbouring countries.

                QR code drives Nepal's digital payment boom</b>
                Post Report <br>
                <br>
                In the past three fiscal years, the total number of digital payment transactions has increased by 43.5 percent. The total transaction value grew by an average 23.7 percent over the years, according to a central bank report.

                The report, titled "Major Activities and Achievements of the Nepal Rastra Bank 2020–2025", published last Friday shows that from the fiscal year 2021–22 to FY2023–24, QR code-based payments saw an average annual increase of 230 percent in transaction volume. In terms of transaction value, QR payments grew 210 percent year on year.

                The report attributes the sharp rise to increased access to digital payment platforms, which has significantly boosted the use of digital payment methods.

            <b>Records galore as Nepal outplay Kuwait</b>
            Post Report <br>
            <br>
            Nepal's men's senior team defeated Kuwait on Thursday to register their second consecutive win in the quadrangular series in Hong Kong. Furthermore, Nepal pulled off their highest-ever T20I chase, successfully chasing 186 with six wickets to spare.

            The game also saw Nepali batters set multiple other national, as well as international, records. Firstly, the opening pair of Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh registered Nepal’s highest T20I partnership for the first wicket.

            Bhurtel and Sheikh took the team to 127 runs in 13.5 overs by the time Sheikh departed for 53 off 38 (2 fours, 4 sixes).

            <b>Quiet spaces and costly cups</b><br>
            Reeve Khanal <br>
            <br>
            The book cafe culture has been steadily growing across the Kathmandu Valley, offering cosy spaces for readers, creatives, and remote workers seeking a quiet escape from the bustle of city life. With a cup of coffee and soft music playing in the background, visitors settle into their rhythm, mixing relaxation with reflection and enjoying their drinks and thoughts.

            Sushmita Baniya, 21, shares her experience with book cafes in Kathmandu, highlighting Ujamaa Koffie & Bakery with Library as her favourite. She values the cafe’s calm and focused environment, with a dedicated reading room that prioritises reading over other distractions, making it a perfect place for bibliophiles. However, she notes that many book cafes, particularly Bodhi Books and Bakes, tend to be expensive, making them less accessible to those from different economic backgrounds. She suggests that more affordable options could help expand the appeal of book cafes and encourage broader reading culture.
